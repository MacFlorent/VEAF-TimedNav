Multiple locations have to be observed. They will be assigned in sequence to your flight with a short description and a required time on target.\
For each of these locations, you are to visually confirm the intel given and then move to the next one.\
\
Takeoff from Incirlik and go to WP#1 to get your first reconnaissance destination.\
A pause in the mission flow after WP#3 will allow you to rejoin with Texaco if you need it.\
Upon reaching the last location, you will be tasked to land at an airbase in Israel or Jordan.\
\
Have good flight.\
