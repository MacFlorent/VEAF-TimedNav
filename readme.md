# Timed navigation over Syria

In this mission you will have to fly a sequence of random waypoints while respecting required times on target.
This is only for reconnaissance. No engagement is authorized, no threats are reported.

Multiple locations have to be observed. They will be assigned in sequence to your flight with a short description and a required time on target.
For each of these locations, you are to visually confirm the intel given and then move to the next one.

Takeoff from Incirlik and go to WP#1 to get your first reconnaissance destination.
A pause in the mission flow after WP#3 will allow you to rejoin with Texaco if you need it.
Upon reaching the last location, you will be tasked to land at an airbase in Israel or Jordan.

Have good flight.
