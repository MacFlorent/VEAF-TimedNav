In this mission you will have to fly a sequence of random waypoints while respecting required times on target.
This is only for reconnaissance. No engagement is authorized, no threats are reported.

Multiple locations have to be observed and will be assigned in sequence to your flight. For each one, a message will inform you of:
- The location coordinates
- A short description
- A required time on target.
A mark will be available on the F10 map as well.

You are to visually confirm the intel given (maybe take a screenshot with your FLIR?) and then move to the next location.

Mission flow:
- Takeoff from Incirlik and go to WP#1 [START]  to start the mission.
- Find the first four (4) targets as they are assigned to your flight.
- Rejoin with Texaco if needed, then go to WP#2 [REFUEL] to continue the mission.
- Reach the last assigned target.
- Go land at the required airfield.

Additional options available in F10 menu:
- Display info on the current leg
- Skip the current leg
- Weather information
